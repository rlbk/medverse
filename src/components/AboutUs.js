            <h3 className="aboutSecContent-title">Why MedVerse?</h3>
            <p>
              We at MedVerse believe that good health is dependent on physical,
              mental and spiritual well being. Having a comprehensive
              understanding of health requires tracking every aspect of an
              individual from birth to death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blockchain technology can be a solution to keeping all patient
              data in a single, secure location. One global blockchain could be
              the foundation of a universal global electronic health record that
              provides all stakeholders with access to patient information in a
              single private digital location.
            </p>
            <p>
              It will be our mission to create a repository that stores all
              medical treatment histories related to physical, mental, and
              spiritual health.All these past health records could help doctors
              predict and treat patients' diseases when they become ill.
